RedBear Blend 2
===============

The RedBear Blend 2 is a microcontroller board based on the Nordic `NRF52832 Cortex-M4F MCU <http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/pdf/nRF52832_PS_v1.0.pdf>`_. 

It is a "full-size" Arduino compatible board which supports most shields. It has on board a Cortex-M3 MCU that supports DAPLink, slot for Apple MFi coprocessor and two Grove connectors.

Power
*****

The RedBear Blend 2 can be powered via the USB connector or with an external power supply. The power source is selected automatically. External (non-USB) power can come either from an AC-to-DC adapter (such as a wall-wart) or battery, and can be connected using a 2.1mm center-positive plug connected to the board's power jack, or directly to the GND and VIN pins.

Connect, Virtualize and Program
*******************************

The RedBear Blend 2 has an on-board DAP Link circuitry that exposes three USB interfaces:

* A serial port over USB
* A mass storage device for drag-n-drop programming flash memory
* A DAP compliant debug channel

DAP Link should be supported natively by all platforms.
Once connected to a USB port, the RedBear Blend 2 board is recognized by Zerynth Studio. The board can be virtualized by clicking the related Studio button without requiring any other user intervention.

Follow these steps to uplink a Zerynth script on a virtualized RedBear Blend 2:

* **Select** the Blend 2 on the **Device Management Toolbar**;
* **Register** the device by clicking the "Z" button from the Zerynth Studio;
* **Create** a Virtual Machine for the device by clicking the "Z" button for the second time;
* **Virtualize** the device by clicking the "Z" button for the third time.

After virtualization, the device is ready to be programmed and the  Zerynth scripts **uploaded**. Just **Select** the virtualized device from the "Device Management Toolbar" and **click** the dedicated "upload" button of Zerynth Studio and **reset** the device by pressing the Reset on-board button when asked.

.. important:: To exploit the BLE chip functionalities of the Blend 2, the :ref:`lib.nordic.nrf52_ble library <nordic_nrf52_ble>` must be installed and imported on the Zerynth script. Moreover, in the creation phase, a VM with BLE support must be selected.
